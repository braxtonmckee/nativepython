# NativePython

The NativePython project is a framework for building high-performance real-time distributed systems in Python.

This is my private fork of the repo, which I'm keeping so that old CI tooling still has somewhere to point.

The project is now generously sponsored by A Priori Investments, and can be found [here](https://github.com/APrioriInvestments/nativepython).
